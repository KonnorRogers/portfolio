## My backstory
{:.mt-8 .text-2xl .font-bold}

I started my career off in the Army Reserves. I served for 6 years as a
Medic. During this time, I worked as an EMT while going to school to get
my Paramedic license. Currently, I work as a Paramedic, and have been a
Paramedic for the last 4 years.

## How did I learn to code?
{:.mt-8 .text-2xl .font-bold}

I learned to code by using various free online resources. The two big resources
I used were
[University of Helsinki Intro to Java](https://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-1/)
where I learned to code in Java. After this course, I went on to learn
Web Development from [TheOdinProject](https://theodinproject.com) where
I learned Javascript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, and many other
fundamentals of Web Development.

## What did I do after finishing courses?
{:.mt-8 .text-2xl .font-bold}

Since
finishing TheOdinProject, I have been to contributing to various open source projects
including [Bridgetown](https://bridgetownrb.com) which this site is
actually built with! In addition I have also been working on various
personal projects using Ruby on Rails as well as React.

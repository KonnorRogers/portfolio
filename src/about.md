## How did I learn to code?
{:.mt-6 .text-center .font-bold}

I learned to code by using various free online resources. The two big resources
I used were
[University of Helsinki Intro to Java](https://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-1/)
where I learned to code in Java. After this course, I went on to learn
Web Development from [TheOdinProject](https://theodinproject.com) where
I learned Javascript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, and many other
fundamentals of Web Development.

Since
finishing TheOdinProject, I have been contributing to various open source projects
including [Bridgetown](https://bridgetownrb.com) which this site is
actually built with! In addition I have also been working on various
personal projects using Ruby on Rails as well as React.
